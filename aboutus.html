            donation events is stored in one place.The term "blood bank" refers
            to a division of a hospital laboratory where the storage of blood
            product occurs and where proper testing is performed to reduce the
            risk of transfusion related events.The process of managing the blood
            bag that is received from the blood donation events needs a proper
            and systematic management.The blood bag must be handled with care

            blood bank in order to handle the blood bag and to make enteries of
